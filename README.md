16S rRNA Sequencing of Aerobic Granular Sludge, grouped by size.

### 1.) Generate phyloseq object

Use define_ps.R 

### 2.) Determine significant taxa, using differential abundance analysis

Use run_ancombc2.R and run_aldex2_t_test.R

Two methods: ANCOM-BC2 and ALDEx2

It is valuable to compare the taxa generated by each method.

### 3.) Visualizations

Use 16S_visualization_main.Rmd

This calls various child Rmd files to generate different visualizations.
