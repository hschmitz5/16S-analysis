16S rRNA Sequencing of Aerobic Granular Sludge, grouped by size.

### 1.) Generate phyloseq object

Use define_ps.R 

### 2.) Determine significant taxa, using differential abundance analysis

Use run_ancombc2.R and run_aldex2_t_test.R

Two methods: ANCOM-BC2 and ALDEx2

It is valuable to compare the taxa generated by each method.

### 3.) Core Functions

- 00_setup.R: initializes packages
- 01_load_data.R: loads data and defines necessary variables
- 02_process_ps.R: defines functions for processing a phyloseq object
- 03_subset.R: define the genera names with relative abundance above rel_ab_cutoff and defines functions to group relative abundance for plotting
- 04_subset_DA.R: uses differential abundance analysis to determine which taxa change over groups
- 05_bias_correct.R: define bias-corrected relative abundance from ANCOM-BC2
  
### 4.) Plotting and Statistics
